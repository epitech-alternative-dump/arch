# This is not an exhaustive list about a very good base
# of packages to install on an arch linux distribution.
# This document will also give some details about
# package managing with pacman, yaourt or pip.

# Pacman is the main and default arch linux package
# manager and allows you to manage all the officially
# supported packages.
# Yaourt is a pacman wrapper that allows you things
# like managing packages from the AUR repository.
# Pip is a standalone package manager focused on python
# v2 and 3 libraries and softs.
#
# Mandatory packages (for system and X server are marked
# with this symbol : #*
